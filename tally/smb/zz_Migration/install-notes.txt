Quick Tips for Network Install

    Always install on the server first.
    The program must be installed on each computer that will use Sage unless you are in a Terminal Services environment.
    You can use the Network Installation Manager to install on multiple PCs simultaneously: start the installation at the first workstation, and then move on to the next.
    The Network Installation Manager will not work over wireless networks.
    When installing using the downloaded Sage 50 installer, the Destination folder is where the install files will be extracted; this is not the program location.
    If operating in a domain environment it may be necessary to set correct Windows permissions on the PeachtreeInstaller2017 folder in order to run the network installation manager. Follow Article ID 10211: "Verify my data file permissions are correctly set" in Related resources.
    Sage 50 Pro Accounting is not multi-user compatible; however, Sage 50 Premium and Sage 50 Quantum Accounting are multi-user compatible.
    Installing through a remote desktop connection or virtual machine will require the following steps to start the install: 

    Press Windows+R keys.
    Type %temp%, and then click OK.
    Double-click RarSFX0 folder.
    Double-click Peachw folder.
    Double-click Install folder.
    Right-click _setup.exe, and then select Run as administrator. 

Quick Tips for Upgrading

    If you choose not to replace the older release, but convert your data into the newer version, you will not be able to use the data with the older release.
    When installing using the downloaded Sage 50 installer, the Destination folder is where the install files will be extracted. This is not the location of the prior release. The prior install location is automatically detected during the installation wizard.
    Installing/uninstalling Sage does not remove or change your company data.
    The first time you open a company it will be converted to be compatible with the new version.
    The Sage Intelligence Reporting module is installed separately.
    If Sage 50 2016.2 is currently installed, it will automatically download the Sage 50 2017 installer and prompt to install when closing the program. As usual, this update needs to be installed on the server or host computer first.
