1. We perform an nmap scan, we notice a webserver running on 10.10.10.37, we then go on to use
   reconnnoitre to perform various scans with various sugestions.

2. We go to the scans directory after performing the inital query and are give a list of suggestions to 
   take. The follwoing is a gobbuster query that can be used for such tests
   
   gobuster dir -u 10.10.10.37 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt  -s '200,204,301,302'
   -e | tee '/root/htb/blocky/recon/10.10.10.37/scans/10.10.10.37_80_gobuster_common.txt'

   Within it we find a plugins directory with a couple file we can download.
3. The files are jar files which we can unzip into a decompile folder. We decompile the BlockyCore.jar and 
   inside one of the directories the is class file. We can decompile the file with a tool called jad. You
   can install the gui via the following: apt install jd-gui -y

   From there you will see a user and its password within the class file.
	public String sqlHost = "localhost";
  	public String sqlUser = "root";
  	public String sqlPass = "8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22";

4. Next step would be to try and brute force our way with the password. We know ftp is open so we can use
   the creds, however this are unusable. Same with the ssh service. Next step would be to look at the site
   and notice that is a wordpress site.

5. Run a wpscan on the webserver to enumerate for any other users.
   COMMAND: wpscan --url http://10.10.10.37 --enumerate u,ap,tt,t -o `pwd`/wpscan.log
   This may take a while.

   But if you browse the site closely you will see a user called notch.
   You can also do this by specifing the following:
   10.10.10.37/index.php?author=1  which gets translated to "http://10.10.10.37/index.php/author/notch/"

6. Now attempt to use the password on the user. Use ssh and it should work. To get root, it is quite simple
   simply attempt the following: sudo -l
   You will be asked for the password so just enter it, now all you need to do is use: sudo su -
   To gain root privileges and you are done
